            <p>In the following training phase you will be shown two different websites.<br>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Please take a close look at the websites and their loading behaviour.<br></li>
                    <li>While looking at the pages, please make sure to click the links <b>as fast as possible </b> so that a red frame appears around them. Links are colored in blue and are underlined.
                        <br><i>The links are not supposed to open another webpage! </i><br>
                        <br>
